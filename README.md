R code for Yafuna/Yonkie manuscript 

Code for exploratory analysis of Agarabi and Adzera pottery characteristics.
Diagnostic piece characteristics were used to train a model to estimate the levels of Adzera pottery in a collection of non-diagnostic pieces.
LA-ICPMS was undertaken on 3 Adzera and 3 Agarabi sherds to identify characteristic signatures.
LA-ICPMS code for getting background subtracted and standardised values is a modified version of TERMITE code (Mischel et al, 2017). Mischel SA, Mertz-Kraus R, Jochum KP & Scholz D (2017) TERMITE: An R Script for Fast Reduction of Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry Data and its Application to Trace Element Measurements. Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry: RCM 31: 1079â€“1087.
Use of the original TERMITE code is recommended.
